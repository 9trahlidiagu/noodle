## How to Use WebStorm 2019.2 for JavaScript Development
 
Once you have downloaded and installed WebStorm 2019.2, you can start working on your JavaScript projects. WebStorm provides a dedicated environment for JavaScript development that supports various frameworks and technologies. Here are some of the features that you can use to boost your productivity and code quality.
 
### Code Quality Analysis
 
WebStorm makes it easy to detect errors and typos in your code. It includes hundreds of inspections for all supported languages and a spelling and grammar checker. It also integrates with Stylelint, ESLint, and other linters. WebStorm will run them against your code as you type and highlight any issues right in the editor[^2^].
 
All errors and warnings are reported in the editor as you type, with many quick-fix options available. You can apply them with a single click or use Alt+Enter to see all the available actions. You can also run code analysis for the whole project or a selected file or folder and see the results in a tool window.
 
### Safe Refactorings
 
Let WebStorm help you with what it is best at â refactoring code safely across the entire codebase. You can rename files, folders, and symbols as well as extract components, methods, or variables without worrying about breaking anything â WebStorm will tell you about any potential problems[^2^].
 
You can use the Refactor This popup (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T) to see all the available refactorings for the current context. You can also use dedicated shortcuts for the most common refactorings, such as Rename (Shift+F6), Extract Variable (Ctrl+Alt+V), Extract Method (Ctrl+Alt+M), and Extract Component (Alt+Enter).
 
### Quick Documentation
 
Want to look up the documentation for a symbol? Press Ctrl+Q to see a popup with the relevant information from MDN or TypeScript definitions. You can also see the type information, parameter hints, and JSDoc comments for any symbol in your code[^2^].
 
If you want to see more details, you can open the Documentation tool window (Ctrl+Shift+F1) or jump to the source code (F4). You can also use WebStorm to generate JSDoc comments for your functions and classes by typing /\*\* above them and pressing Enter.
