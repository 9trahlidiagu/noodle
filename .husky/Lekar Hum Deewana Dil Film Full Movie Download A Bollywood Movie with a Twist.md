The film marks the debut of Armaan Jain, who is the grandson of Raj Kapoor and cousin of Ranbir Kapoor. Armaan has shown potential as an actor, but he needs to work on his expressions and dialogue delivery. Deeksha Seth, who has acted in several Telugu films, makes her Bollywood debut with this film. She is confident and charming, but she also needs to polish her acting skills. The supporting cast includes Varun Badola, Gautami Kapoor, Rohini Hattangadi, and Kumud Mishra, who do a decent job.
  
Lekar Hum Deewana Dil is a film that tries to capture the spirit of the youth and their quest for love and freedom. It is a film that has some moments of fun and romance, but also some moments of boredom and predictability. It is a film that could have been better with a tighter script and a more engaging direction.
  
Lekar Hum Deewana Dil was not a successful film at the box office. The film had a poor opening day collection of 0.5 crore and could not pick up much over the weekend. The film ended its first week with a collection of 2.40 crore and could not cross the 3 crore mark in its lifetime. The film was declared a flop by trade analysts.
  
The film also failed to make an impact in the overseas markets. The film collected a meagre amount of 110,100 AED in UAE, 11,635 Pound in UK, and 10,529 USD in USA. The film did not release in other major markets like Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. The film's worldwide gross was around 20,874 USD.
  
Lekar Hum Deewana Dil was a disappointment for the makers and the distributors. The film could not recover its production and marketing costs, which were estimated to be around 16 crore. The film also could not launch the careers of its debutant actors, Armaan Jain and Deeksha Seth, who have not appeared in any other Bollywood film since then.
