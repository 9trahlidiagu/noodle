This text provides a list of free PDF ebooks that can be downloaded by users who are interested in learning about data structures and algorithms. The ebooks are based on different sources, such as manuals, guides, sheets, and textbooks. One of the ebooks is "Data Structures and Algorithms: Concepts, Techniques and Applications" by G. A. V. Pai, which is a comprehensive and illustrative text that covers various topics related to data structures and algorithms, such as arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, searching, hashing, and more. The text is independent of any programming language and uses pseudocodes to explain the algorithms. The text also includes several examples, problems, and programming assignments to help students practice and apply the concepts. Another ebook is "Classic Data Structures" by D. Samanta, which is a book that explains the basics of data structures and algorithms using C++ as the programming language. The book covers topics such as abstract data types, recursion, stacks, queues, lists, trees, heaps, graphs, hashing, sorting, and searching. The book also provides a clear and concise presentation of the theory and applications of data structures and algorithms.
