By using this option, you can also contribute to the community by seeding the torrents, which means sharing the files with other users who are downloading them.

Alternatively, you can also use a different torrent client software to download torrents from the Internet Archive. Some examples of popular torrent clients are uTorrent, Vuze, and Transmission.
