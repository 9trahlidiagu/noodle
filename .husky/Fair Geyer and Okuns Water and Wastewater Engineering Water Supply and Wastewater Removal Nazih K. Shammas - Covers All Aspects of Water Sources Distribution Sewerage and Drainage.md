# Review of Fair, Geyer, and Okun's, Water and Wastewater Engineering: Water Supply and Wastewater Removal by Nazih K. Shammas and Lawrence K. Wang
  
If you are looking for a comprehensive and updated text on water and wastewater engineering, you might want to check out Fair, Geyer, and Okun's, Water and Wastewater Engineering: Water Supply and Wastewater Removal by Nazih K. Shammas and Lawrence K. Wang. This book is based on the classic text by Fair, Greyer, and Okun, which has been revised and expanded to include eight new chapters by university professors and engineers practicing in the field[^1^].

The book covers all aspects of water supply, water sources, water distribution, sanitary sewerage and urban stormwater drainage. It reflects current practice, includes access to an academic version of the commercial software Haestad Methods Water Solutions by Bentley, and now includes homework problems[^1^]. The book also provides examples and problems using both U.S. and SI systems equations[^2^].
  
The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the basic concepts of water systems; Part II deals with water supply engineering; Part III covers wastewater engineering; and Part IV discusses engineering projects management. Some of the topics covered in the book are surface water, groundwater, rainfall and runoff, urban runoff and combined sewer overflow management, quantities of water and wastewater flows, water hydraulics transmission and appurtenances, pumping storage and dual water systems, cross-connection control, hydraulics of sewer systems, design of sewer systems, sewer pipe replacement, modeling and computer applications, sewer material appurtenances and maintenance, trenchless technology and sewer system rehabilitation, alternative wastewater collection systems, prevention through design and system safety[^2^] [^3^].
  
The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students in civil engineering, environmental engineering, water resources engineering, sanitary engineering, as well as for practicing engineers in the field of water and wastewater engineering. The book is well-written, well-organized, well-illustrated, and well-referenced. It provides a solid foundation for understanding and applying scientific principles to the design and operation of water and wastewater systems.

In addition to the technical aspects of water and wastewater engineering, the book also addresses some of the social, economic, and environmental issues related to water and wastewater management. For example, the book discusses the challenges of providing safe and adequate water supply to developing countries, the effects of climate change on water resources and quality, the role of water conservation and reuse in reducing water demand and enhancing sustainability, the ethical and legal aspects of water rights and allocation, and the public health implications of waterborne diseases and contaminants[^2^] [^3^].
  
The book is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about water and wastewater engineering. It offers a comprehensive and updated coverage of the theory and practice of water and wastewater treatment, as well as a critical analysis of the current and emerging issues in the field. The book is also a useful reference for professionals and practitioners who are involved in the planning, design, operation, and maintenance of water and wastewater systems.
