Now that you have activated your AutoCAD software using XForce Keygen, you may want to explore some of the features and benefits of AutoCAD. Here are some of them:

- AutoCAD allows you to create 2D drawings and 3D models with precision and accuracy. You can use text, dimensions, tables, leaders, and other annotations to enhance your drawings. You can also apply formulas, link to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, and import data from other sources[^1^].
- AutoCAD provides you with industry-specific toolsets for architecture, mechanical, electrical, map 3D, MEP, plant 3D, raster design, and more. You can access these toolsets from the desktop or the web app[^1^].
- AutoCAD enables you to collaborate with your team and clients across devices and Autodesk products. You can use the web app or the mobile app to create, edit, and view your drawings from any browser or device. You can also use the Share feature to send a controlled copy of your drawing to anyone with a link[^1^].
- AutoCAD supports various file formats and standards for importing and exporting data. You can work with DWG, DXF, DWF, PDF, STL, STEP, IGES, and other formats. You can also use Xref Compare to compare two versions of an external reference (xref) and implement changes without leaving your current drawing[^1^].
- AutoCAD offers you various customization options to suit your preferences and workflows. You can use APIs such as LISP, .NET, JavaScript, and C++ to automate tasks and create custom applications. You can also use the Autodesk App Store to find and download plugins and extensions for AutoCAD[^2^].
