**DOWNLOAD ——— [https://t.co/XaWInX9Ot8](https://t.co/XaWInX9Ot8)**


 
The error is caused by a missing DLL file called **MSVCR71.dll**, which is required by the game's SecuROM protection system. This file may be deleted by some antivirus programs or corrupted by other software. To fix the error, you need to download the file and place it in the game's Binaries folder.
 
Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Go to [this website](https://www.dll-files.com/dllindex/dll-files.shtml?msvcr71) and download the MSVCR71.dll file. Make sure you have an antivirus program active before downloading anything from the internet.
2. Extract the file from the ZIP archive and copy it to the Binaries folder of your game installation. The default location is **C:\Program Files\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\Binaries**.
3. Right-click on the MSVCR71.dll file and select Properties. Check the box next to Read-only and click OK. This will prevent the file from being deleted or modified by other programs.
4. Launch the game and enjoy!

If this solution does not work for you, you may need to update your graphics drivers, reinstall the game, or contact SecuROM support for further assistance.

## What is SecuROM and why does it cause errors?
 
SecuROM is a digital rights management (DRM) system that is used by some game publishers to prevent piracy and unauthorized copying of their products. SecuROM works by verifying the game's disc or activation code before allowing it to run on the user's computer.
 
However, SecuROM can also cause problems for legitimate users, such as compatibility issues, performance issues, or error messages. Some of these problems are related to the SecuROM software itself, while others are caused by conflicts with other programs or hardware on the user's system.
