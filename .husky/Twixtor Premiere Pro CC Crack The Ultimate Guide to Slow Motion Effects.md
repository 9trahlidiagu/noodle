# How to Install and Use Twixtor Plugin for Premiere Pro CC
 
Twixtor is a plugin that allows you to create stunning slow motion and speed up effects in Premiere Pro CC. It works by analyzing the motion of the pixels in your footage and creating new frames based on the interpolation of the original ones. This way, you can change the frame rate of your video without losing quality or introducing artifacts.

## How to Install Twixtor Plugin for Premiere Pro CC
 
1. Download the installer for Twixtor from the website where you purchased it. Make sure you choose the right version for your operating system and Premiere Pro CC version.

3. Restart Premiere Pro CC if it was running during the installation.
4. Open a project in Premiere Pro CC and import the footage you want to apply Twixtor to.
5. Create a new sequence or use an existing one. Drag and drop your footage onto the timeline.
6. Go to the Effects panel and search for Twixtor. You should find it under Video Effects > RE:Vision Plug-ins > Twixtor.
7. Drag and drop Twixtor onto your footage on the timeline. A blue banner will appear on the clip indicating that an effect has been applied.

## How to Use Twixtor Plugin for Premiere Pro CC
 
The most important parameter in Twixtor is the Speed setting. This determines how fast or slow your footage will play back. By default, it is set to 100%, which means no change in speed. You can change this value by dragging the slider or typing a number in the box. For example, if you set it to 50%, your footage will play back at half speed. If you set it to 200%, your footage will play back at double speed.
 
You can also keyframe the Speed setting to create dynamic speed changes over time. To do this, move the playhead to where you want to start the speed change and click on the stopwatch icon next to Speed. This will create a keyframe with the current value. Then move the playhead to where you want to end the speed change and change the Speed value. This will create another keyframe with the new value. Premiere Pro CC will automatically interpolate between the keyframes and create a smooth transition in speed.
 
Another important parameter in Twixtor is the Frame Interp setting. This determines how Twixtor creates new frames based on the original ones. By default, it is set to Motion Weighted Blend, which means that Twixtor blends multiple frames together using motion vectors. This usually produces good results, but sometimes it can cause ghosting or blurring artifacts when there is fast or complex motion in your footage.
 
You can change this setting to one of the other options depending on your footage and preference. For example, you can choose Nearest Frame if you want Twixtor to use only one frame as a reference for each new frame. This can reduce artifacts, but it can also introduce stuttering or judder effects when there is not enough motion in your footage. You can also choose Smart Blend if you want Twixtor to use a more advanced algorithm that analyzes each pixel individually and decides whether to blend or not. This can produce better results than Motion Weighted Blend, but it can also take longer to render.
