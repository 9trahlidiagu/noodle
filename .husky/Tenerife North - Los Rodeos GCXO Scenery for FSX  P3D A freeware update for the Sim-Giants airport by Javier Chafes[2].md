Tenerife is the largest and most populous of the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago in the Atlantic Ocean. It is also home to two major airports: Tenerife South (GCTS) and Tenerife North (GCXO). The latter, also known as Los Rodeos, is the subject of this review. RFscenerydesign has released a new version of their Tenerife North scenery for FSX and P3D, which promises to enhance the realism and immersion of flying to this beautiful island.

The scenery covers the airport and its surroundings, with high-resolution photoreal textures, custom 3D buildings, dynamic lighting, animated vehicles, static objects, and more. It also includes a custom mesh and landclass for the nearby city of La Laguna, as well as some landmarks such as the University of La Laguna and the Basilica of Candelaria. The scenery is compatible with Orbx Global Base and Vector, as well as other third-party addons.
 
I tested the scenery with P3D v4.5 on a mid-range system, and I was impressed by the performance and quality of the product. The airport looks very realistic and detailed, with accurate runway markings, taxiway signs, apron lighting, and terminal buildings. The textures are crisp and colorful, and the night lighting is stunning. The surrounding area is also well done, with realistic roads, buildings, vegetation, and water. The mesh and landclass blend well with the photoreal textures, creating a seamless transition from the airport to the city.
 
The scenery also features some nice touches that add to the immersion, such as animated vehicles on the airport and on the roads, static aircraft and ground service equipment, and custom sound effects. The airport also has a realistic AFCAD file that allows AI traffic to use the correct parking spots and taxiways. The scenery is easy to install and configure, with a user-friendly control panel that lets you adjust various options such as dynamic lighting, static objects, sound effects, and more.
 
Overall, I think RFscenerydesign has done a great job with their Tenerife North Los Rodeos V1.2 GCXO scenery for FSX and P3D. It is a faithful representation of the real airport and its surroundings, with high-quality textures, 3D models, lighting, animations, and sounds. It is also very performance-friendly and compatible with other addons. If you are looking for a new destination to fly to in the Canary Islands, I highly recommend this scenery.
  
To test the scenery, I decided to fly a short hop from Tenerife North to Gran Canaria (GCLP), another popular airport in the Canary Islands. I chose the Aerosoft A320 as my aircraft, and I used Active Sky for the weather. I also enabled AI traffic with Ultimate Traffic Live, and ATC with ProATC/X.
 
I started at gate 8, where I set up the aircraft and requested clearance from ATC. The weather was partly cloudy, with a light breeze from the north. I was assigned runway 12 for departure, and I followed the taxi instructions to the holding point. The airport was busy, with several AI aircraft landing and taking off. I had to wait for a few minutes before I was cleared for takeoff.
 
As I lifted off the runway, I admired the view of the airport and the city below. The scenery looked amazing, with realistic shadows and reflections on the buildings and the water. I followed the SID (standard instrument departure) and climbed to my cruising altitude of 15,000 feet. The flight was smooth and uneventful, with only some light turbulence along the way. The scenery of the Canary Islands was beautiful, with green mountains, sandy beaches, and blue sea.

After about 20 minutes of flying, I contacted Gran Canaria Approach and requested vectors for landing. I was assigned runway 03L, and I began my descent. As I approached the island, I could see the airport and its surroundings in the distance. The scenery of Gran Canaria was also very detailed and realistic, with custom 3D buildings, photoreal textures, and dynamic lighting. I aligned myself with the runway and prepared for landing.
 
I touched down smoothly and applied the brakes. I exited the runway and contacted Ground for taxi instructions. I was directed to gate 14, where I parked the aircraft and shut down the engines. I had completed a successful flight from Tenerife North to Gran Canaria, thanks to RFscenerydesign's excellent scenery.
