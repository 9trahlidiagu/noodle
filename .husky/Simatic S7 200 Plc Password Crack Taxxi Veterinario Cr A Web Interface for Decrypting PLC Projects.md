If you have forgotten your Simatic S7 200 Plc password and you cannot download your new logic, you may be wondering how to crack it and reset your Plc to factory defaults. In this article, we will show you some possible ways to do that, based on some online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. However, please note that we do not endorse or guarantee the validity or safety of these methods, and you should use them at your own risk.
 
## Method 1: Use a Reset to Default Memory Card
 
According to the S7-200 SMART system manual[^1^], you can create a reset to default memory card by using a standard Micro SDHC card and formatting it with Windows. Then, you need to copy a file named "RESET\_TO\_DEFAULT" to the root directory of the card. You can download this file from the Siemens website or create it yourself by using a text editor and saving it as a plain text file with no extension. The file should contain only one line of text: "RESET\_TO\_DEFAULT".

After creating the card, you need to insert it into the memory card slot of your Plc and power cycle it within 60 seconds. The Plc will then read the file from the card and reset itself to factory defaults, including clearing the password and the program in memory. You can then remove the card and download your new logic.
 
## Method 2: Use a PC/PPI Cable and Software
 
Another possible way to crack your Simatic S7 200 Plc password is to use a PC/PPI cable and software such as STEP 7-MicroWIN SMART[^3^]. This software allows you to connect your PC to your Plc and perform various operations, such as uploading, downloading, monitoring, debugging, etc. However, if your Plc is password protected, you will need to enter the correct password before you can access it.

To crack the password, you can try using a special command called "CLEAR" in the software. This command is supposed to reset your Plc to factory defaults and forget the password. To use it, you need to select CLEAR from the menu bar, then select "Reset to factory defaults and forget password". You will then see a message asking you to power cycle your Plc within 60 seconds. After doing that, your Plc should be unlocked and ready for downloading your new logic.
 
However, some users have reported that this method does not work for them[^1^], and they still see the password prompt after power cycling their Plc. In that case, you may need to try another method or contact Siemens for support.
 
## Method 3: Use a Password Cracker Software
 
The last method we will mention is to use a password cracker software that can attempt to guess or bypass your Simatic S7 200 Plc password. There are some online sources that claim to offer such software for free or for a fee[^3^], but we cannot verify their legitimacy or effectiveness. Moreover, using such software may violate Siemens' terms of service or intellectual property rights, and may expose your PC or Plc to malware or other risks.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend using this method unless you have no other choice and you are fully aware of the potential consequences. If you decide to use a password cracker software, you will need to follow the instructions provided by the source and run it on your PC while connected to your Plc via a PC/PPI cable. The software may then try to brute force or exploit some vulnerability in your Plc's password protection mechanism and unlock it for you.
 
## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you some possible ways to crack your Simatic S7 200 Plc password and reset it to factory defaults. However, these methods are not guaranteed to work and may involve some risks or drawbacks. Therefore, we advise you to use them with caution and at your own responsibility. Alternatively, you can try contacting Siemens for support or consulting a professional technician who can help you with your problem.
