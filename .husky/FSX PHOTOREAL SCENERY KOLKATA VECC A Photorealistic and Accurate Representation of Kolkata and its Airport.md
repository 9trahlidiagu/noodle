The airport was one of the first in India to have scheduled flights, starting with KLM in 1924. The airport also witnessed some historic events, such as the first round-the-world expedition by the Royal Air Force in 1924 and the departure of Subhas Chandra Bose for Germany in 1941[^1^].

The years between the 1940s and 1960s saw the airport explode in popularity as a stopover hub. The airport handled flights from Aeroflot, Alitalia, Cathay Pacific, Philippine Airlines, Pan Am, KLM, and many more. The airport was also a gateway to Southeast Asia and Australia, as well as a strategic base during World War II and the Bangladesh Liberation War[^3^]. However, the airport's glory days soon faded as newer and larger airports emerged in Delhi and Mumbai, reducing Kolkata's importance as a transit point.
 
In recent years, Kolkata Airport has undergone several modernization and expansion projects to cope with the increasing demand for air travel in eastern India. The airport opened a new integrated terminal in 2013, which increased its capacity to 25 million passengers per year. The airport also added new facilities such as a metro station, a cargo complex, a solar power plant, and a second runway. The airport is now aiming to become a regional hub for flights to Northeast India and neighboring countries[^2^].
